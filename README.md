## Project description

Website creation with parallax and Dark/Light theme.

In addition to the standard Dark/Light mode, I added a more subtle touch: the 
## "living" Dark/Light mode.

Based on a landscape photographer portfolio (fictitious), 

I put forward his talent through one of his landscape, 
with thim on it, 
in daylight "Light mode" and the same landscape in night "Dark mode".
with an addional parallax to animate the whole.
